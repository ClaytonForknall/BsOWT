Description: Builds the wavelet transform matrix (W) corresponding to a
    specified order of second generation B-spline wavelet, following the
    methods detailed in Forknall et al (in prep) and Jansen (2016)
    (https://doi.org/10.1142/S0219691316500569).  Types of wavelet
    B-spline currently supported are `Haar` (p=1), `linear` (p=2) and `cubic` (p=4).
    The semi-orthogonal approach is used to form the wavelet transform
    matrix, as detailed in Jansen (2016)
    (https://doi.org/10.1142/S0219691316500569) and Jansen (2022)
    (Wavelets from a Statistical Perspective textbook, CRC Press).
