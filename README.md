# BsOWT package: Second generation wavelet B-splines

Package to build the wavelet transform matrix corresponding to a specified order of second generation B-spline wavelet, following the methods detailed in Forknall et al. (in prep) and Jansen (2016) (https://doi.org/10.1142/S0219691316500569).

Types of B-spline wavelet currently supported are Haar (p=1), linear (p=2) and cubic (p=4).

The semi-orthogonal approach is used to construct the final update matrix, as detailed in Jansen (2016) (https://doi.org/10.1142/S0219691316500569) and Jansen (2022) (Wavelets from a Statistical Perspective textbook, CRC Press).
